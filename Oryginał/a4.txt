Have AI got neurons too?

If you've ever read anything more about artificial intelligence, you should know what a perceptron is, namely: <span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />an artificial neuron</span>.<br />

 The average human brain has about 100 billion neurons. The structure of these micronutrients is very simple: <br />
 other neurons will emit electrical impulses to the dendrites of our cell (which can be compared to information that
we deliver to the computer via USB), <br /> they stimulate it, if they are strong enough, then it sends its impulse further.
Pretty simple, right?

That's why the concept of a perceptron was introduced in 1957! These are very old times looking at computers from
they have been standing in museums for a long time and we have been using this little simple system for so long.

It is amazing that such an inconspicuous thing used first in calculations in today's world is the basis for artificial construction
intelligence that we can teach how they should behave, that is, if they get the right impulses, e.g. someone
told me something nice, then we teach such artificial intelligence to make her smile.

Since we have been using this system for so long, whether and for how long it will satisfy our desire to discover,
will we be able to build fully functioning artificial intelligence and will we be able to control it?
The technique is developing in the right direction for now, but time will be the best to verify our skills.
