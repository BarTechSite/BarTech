Hulk's strength for probably only (price)$
|
Did you have some moments in your life that you didn't have enough strength to do something or open something?<br />
 
Maybe you have problems with being tired after working physically?<br />

That's your solution! - <span style="font-weight:bold;"> An Exoskeleton!</span>
|
<p>

It's made of both electrical and mechanical parts, it uses lots of engines powered by an acummulator to grant you comfort 
and make certain parts of your body move easier. It was made to help people dealing with difficulties in walking or 
other kinds of disabilites. It's also supposed to be used by soldiers to carry heavy stuff, such as backs, but 
creators of those say, that exoskeletons will serve for everyone, and let them carry really heavy things, such as 
big metal constructions, and not let them suffer with it.

But... what about costs of an Exoskeleton? For now those will be only used by special testers, or certain divisions of cetrain forces up to the mark of Navy Seals. The Exoskeleton must be tested rigorically before letting usual people use it in case it breaks down.
