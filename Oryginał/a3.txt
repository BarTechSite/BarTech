City of your dreams in Bladerunner
|
There are many concepts of <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">City of The Future</span>.
Bladerunner shows probably the most cult of it you can see in films.<br />
But could your city look like that?

<p>
Just try to imagine that in a few years time we could live in enormous metropolis, where you would be surrounded by skyscrapers,
everything would be shining in all the colors you know, all the cultures of the world would be on the streets as well as flying cars and YOU.
Yes. You stand in the center of it, in this beautiful futuristic crowd. Isn't that what we would like to see?
Aren't we going to let our world look like that? Today it is our dream, to make it possible.

Now, will you be shocked if I would tell you, that we haven't made any progress in this case?
In the 80's people were imagining the same. We are just copying this imagination/solution in many ways (art, games, movies etc.).
Original Blade Runner that has been released in 1982, showed views of the "city of future".
So now guess what was the year of film's action.
2019. Their dream was to let us live in the world, we can just imagine. But what stop us from doing so?

Not our cities, but lifestyle are closer to those of Blade Runner. It isn't this what you see in the cinema,
but just compare, for example phones from 90's and present times.
Smartphone that you hold in your hand have millions times more computing power than the strongest personal computer in 82’. 
Today you protect your data with fingerprint or even the retina. 
In 80's it was just depending on the case if you had a document or a computer - often you weren’t able to have a password.
It will be a long time before we will live with *robots powered by AI*, but do you know that Siri or Cortana are
mile step to let it be closer? We (as humanity) have built some *androids that could live with us*,
but I'm sure that you can distinguish human from one of these.
What's interesting one of these - got citizenship in Saudi Arabia, but there were some problems, because it (or she) has got more rights than a woman.
